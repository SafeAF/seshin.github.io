Sam aka @seshin has been caught calculating the kolmgorov complexity of physical objects and other algorithmic information theoretics. In love with ruby and its high degree of expressiveness. Over 13 years professional programming, first programming gig at 15 as a summer student at Stanford. Ended up getting full time employment after a summer or two. A total of over 10 years there, at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Recently worked on a ruby project (unreleased as of June 2015) and also a PHP project FortiDirector at Fortinet.

Currently playing lead researcher and developer at a startup I founded way back in 2008. Initially as a consultancy, I've since pivoted the company to developing next generation IDS technology. Brought in a couple excellent people, a developer @raymondcolebaugh and a business/sales side guy with over 20 years experience here in the valley. He has cultivated relatonships with virtually every major company in the tech field; and numerous smaller ones. At his request I won't divulge his name, but needless to say we have a well rounded team. We are very close to having an MVP and we are currently considering raising capital.

A note about the handle, seshin is the japanese buddhist term for sitting meditation; a practice i do with regularity and believe in fervently as a solution to many of the ills of modern personhood.
